# Darya

We are decided to go with a web-based platform, Because of these points :

Easy for Everyone to Get Onboard

Works on any gadget whether consumer got a basic smartphone or a fancy computer, they can jump right onto this platform. No one's left out because of the device they have.
Consumer don't need the latest and greatest gadgets to use it. It's perfect for folks who can't afford top-of-the-line stuff.
We can push updates to everyone at once. Consumer won't have to bother with downloading the latest version.

 Cheeper Solution

All they need is an internet connection. No need to buy expensive software or apps.
As more people join in, scaling up the platform is smoother than with traditional apps. It's all about reaching as many people as possible.

In a nutshell, choosing a web-based approach for Darya is spot on. It's all about making education accessible to everyone, no matter their tech setup or where they're from. It's affordable, easy to grow, and most importantly, it opens doors for all sorts of learners.
